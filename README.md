**Exploring TikTok: EDA and Logistic Regression**  
TikTok Project \n
I will build a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion.

Before building a machine learing model, I have decided to explore how to predict verified status to understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, I conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.

Regression modeling
In this notebook, I will build a logistic regression model in Python. Logistic regression helps estimate the probability of an outcome.

The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and regression models.

The goal is to build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model.

This activity has three parts:

Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation

Part 3: Interpreting Model Results
